This mini-project was one of the first I have ever built. It is a simple app that creates a grid with desired length and colors squares on hover. App is written with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and was my first hands-on experience with DOM manipulation.  Looking back it was a simple but essential project to understand the underlying logic of DOM manipulation and core HTML and CSS concepts.
Plus - 5-year-olds love it!
