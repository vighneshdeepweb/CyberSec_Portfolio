### Overview

The project was a solution to <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>URL Shortener challenge.</span></a>
It was a good challenge to solidify my external API usage, responsive layout, and React skills.

### The challenge

The challenge was to integrate with the shrtcode API to create shortened URLs and display them like in the designs.
User stories that needed to be fulfilled:
<ul>
<li>-View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size</li>
<li>-Shorten any valid URL</li>
<li>-See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser</li>
<li>-Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click</li>
<li>-Receive an error message when the form is submitted if The input field is empty</li>
</ul>
