### Overview

The project was a solution to <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>Sunnyside agency landing page challenge.</span></a>
I decided that my portfolio of projects is lacking something good-looking and well designed so coding that landing page would be a good experience and asset.

### The challenge

This was my first project using Tailwind CSS. Utility and Mobile First CSS was a challenge itself. Nevertheless, the experience was really good and allowed me to create this project in a little more than 24 hours.
